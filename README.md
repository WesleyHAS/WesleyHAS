## About me

My original career was as a professional Chef, but due to a wrist injury, I was forced to hang up my apron and explore new opportunities. This experience rekindled my passion and curiosity for the tech field. I thrive in high-pressure environments and enjoy problem-solving. I graduated from the University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Coding Bootcamp in 2024.

In a previous life, I wore the hat of a Chef. Cooking isn't just a skill; it's a creative expression that taught me the art of multitasking, urgency, and maintaining a sense of calm under pressure. My journey in the culinary world has contributed to my problem-solving abilities and instilled a strong sense of discipline.

Feel free to explore my GitHub for a glimpse into my coding journey. I'm always up for a chat about tech, culinary adventures, or anything in between. Connect with me on LinkedIn and let's embark on new possibilities together! Looking forward to the exciting journey ahead!
